## October

Hadn't run since getting Randy and frankly, since some personal family troubles earlier in the summer. Rough patches can come in may forms and sometimes things can collide to create a pretty nsaty storm. Yet, I survived and we're all better off now, stronger, and weathered.

**Training**
None!
**Pre-race**
Got there early and checked out the scene. Regular stuff and people coming and going. We decided to grab some pre-race coffee and ice cream. This pretty cool ice-cream hop (is that right?) gave us some samples and we both knew that the mango was the best! After, we waited on the beach for the start.
**Race**
The start & finish at is on Moonlight Beach in Encinitas and we run an out and back during low tide on the sand right on the crashing surf and steep cliffs with people relaxing and watching on the beach. Its a pretty cool race in this regards. Second time running and probably my last but no regrets!
**Post-race**
Felt great. I didn't over do it since I had no training and I have my sights on some real races in the beginning of the year I want to be healthy and train for. This start that phase!

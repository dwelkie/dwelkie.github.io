### KaiA and Circadian Clock Regulation

For my postdoctoral career contributions, I want to focus on studying the relationship between the circadian clock in the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus sp. PCC 7942 and the regulation of metabolic processes, especially those important for diurnal growth.

### Genetic Fitness and Interaction Screens

## Purdue

### Modifying Carbohydrate Storage and Strain Physiology

 My graduate career contributions focused on genetics and physiology of cyanobacteria for industrial applications. My dissertation titles “An integrated approach to develop unicellular cyanobacteria for biofuel production” described how to improve the physiological characteristics of the nitrogen fixing cyanobacterium Cyanothece sp. PC 7822, where I enhanced growth and culture population homogeneity was through nutrient adjustment. <br/>

I created mutant strains of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 that had modified carbohydrate metabolism to study the genetic rationale for the variation of stored carbohydrate granule morphologies across species.<br/>

### Photosynthetic Isoprene Biosynthesis

Lastly, participated in a project to engineer Synechocystis to produce the C5 compound, isoprene, and validated computational model predictions to optimize productivity.

### Gene Expression in Light-Dark Cycles

I also performed transcriptomics and proteomics across the diurnal cycle that detailed the synchronicity of transcriptional and translational processes. <br/>

### Microbial Community Dynamics to Environmental Disturbance

Microbial communities in different environments using 16S rRNA. I began my research experience under the supervision of Dr. Paul Weimer at the USDA Forage Research Center at the University of Wisconsin Madison were I used my knowledge of molecular biology and microbiology to study microbial community dynamics in dairy cows across feeding cycles. <br/>

The result of this project was a first authored paper that was the first to report how solid-associated microbial communities show less change in composition within and across feeding cycles than liquid-associated bacteria using automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis. I next focused on microbial communities in fresh water lakes working under the supervision of Dr. Katherine McMahon and Dr. Ashley Shade on a Northern Temperate Lakes Microbial Observatory Project. 

This project set out to separate the environmental drivers of microbial communities in freshwater ecosystems in response to seasonal and abrupt disturbances. This project, too, resulted in a co-authored manuscript. My role in both these projects was to collect the samples from the field, perform DNA extractions and assist with data analysis and manuscript writing. <br/>

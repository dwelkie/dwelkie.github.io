I am a molecular biologist who can't get enough of working with and learning about microbial metabolism and genetics. I earned my BS in **microbiology** at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and was fortunate enough to participate in some research projects studying microbioal ecology while there which ultimately instill in me a passion for science and the potienital of microbial biotechnology. 

e focused on analysis of microbial communities in different environments using 16S rRNA. I began my research experience under the supervision of Dr. Paul Weimer at the USDA Forage Research Center at the University of Wisconsin Madison were I used my knowledge of molecular biology and microbiology to study microbial community dynamics in dairy cows across feeding cycles. The result of this project was a first authored paper that was the first to report how solid-associated microbial communities show less change in composition within and across feeding cycles than liquid-associated bacteria using automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis. I next focused on microbial communities in fresh water lakes working under the supervision of Dr. Katherine McMahon and Dr. Ashley Shade on a Northern Temperate Lakes Microbial Observatory Project. This project set out to separate the environmental drivers of microbial communities in freshwater ecosystems in response to seasonal and abrupt disturbances. This project, too, resulted in a co-authored manuscript. My role in both these projects was to collect the samples from the field, perform DNA extractions and assist with data analysis and manuscript writing. 

My graduate career contributions focused on genetics and physiology of cyanobacteria for industrial applications. My dissertation titles “An integrated approach to develop unicellular cyanobacteria for biofuel production” described how to improve the physiological characteristics of the nitrogen fixing cyanobacterium Cyanothece sp. PC 7822, where I enhanced growth and culture population homogeneity was through nutrient adjustment, I also performed transcriptomics and proteomics across the diurnal cycle that detailed the synchronicity of transcriptional and translational processes, and I created mutant strains of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 that had modified carbohydrate metabolism to study the genetic rationale for the variation of stored carbohydrate granule morphologies across species. Lastly, participated in a project to engineer Synechocystis to produce the C5 compound, isoprene, and validated computational model predictions to optimize productivity.

For my postdoctoral career contributions, I want to focus on studying the relationship between the circadian clock in the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus sp. PCC 7942 and the regulation of metabolic processes, especially those important for diurnal growth.
I Experienced working with a variety of microbial strains, many of which are photosynthetic, to develop ways for engineering bacterial metabolism for biotechnology. I enjoy working on teams to leverage multiple skill sets on common goals and sharing my research with others. In addition to thriving on the bench, I have much experience mentoring students and fellow scientists on experimental design, techniques, and project management. A common drive in my work experience has been to take advantage of microbial metabolism for bioproduction — whether that be in producing consistent milk from dairy cows by studying rumen microbes in Wisconsin as an undergraduate, producing hydrogen and isprenoids in different cyanobacterial strains as a graduate student at Purdue, or leveraging the powerful regulatory influence of the circadian clock on gene expression in the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus to produce hearty strains for industrial cultivation and improved fitness as a postdoc at UCSD working with Susan Golden and Bernhard Palsson. 

This passion has led me to develop skills in DNA assembly and genetic engineering for targeted investigations, utilizing different -omics approaches and Tn-library screening for a systems level discovery, and computational tools to model the system and predict metabolic flux and essential reactions for different goals.

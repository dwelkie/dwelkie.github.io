    excerpt: 'An integrated approach to develop unicellular cyanobacteria for biofuel production‚Äù described how to improve the physiological characteristics of the nitrogen fixing cyanobacterium Cyanothece sp. PC 7822, where I enhanced growth and culture population homogeneity was through nutrient adjustment, I also performed transcriptomics and proteomics across the diurnal cycle that detailed the synchronicity of transcriptional and translational processes, and I created mutant strains of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 that had modified carbohydrate metabolism to study the genetic rationale for the variation of stored carbohydrate granule morphologies across species. Lastly, participated in a project to engineer Synechocystis to produce the C5 compound, isoprene, and validated computational model predictions to optimize productivity.'

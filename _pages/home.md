## Bio:
As post-doctoral researcher at the Center for Circadian Biology at the University of California in San Diego, I focus on improving our understanding of bacterial metabolism using molecular biology techniques and genome-scale modeling to better enable engineering efforts. I received my PhD from Biological Sciences Department at Purdue University and my BS in microbiology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Beyond research, I enjoy running and going to major league baseball games whenever I can (go padres!).

I am working as a post-doctoral researcher at the Center for Circadian Biology at the University of California San Diego. I mainly focus on imporving out understanding of bacterial metabolism using molecular biology techniques and genome-scale modeling. I recieved my PhD from Biological Sciences Department at Purdue university. 

Besides my research, I enjoy running half marathons and going to major leage baseball games whenever I can.

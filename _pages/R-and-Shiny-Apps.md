Of the number of things I learned off the bench during my postdoc, I feel that R data-analysis and Shiny to be one of the neatest. Shiny allows to make interactive application that allow others to play with and explore your awesome datasets. It really makes for a good impression and provides a way for people to connect and get 'hands-on' with the information you are excited about.

The coolest part if that you can allow others who may not be R-programming friendly to be able to see and interact with the data made by R and deploy it online freely. The shiny app I made for the fitness values from the light-dark screen of the bar-coded transposon mutant library is online:

Can you see how impressive these are and there are examples on the web of much more impressive ones that the relatively simple one I made here.

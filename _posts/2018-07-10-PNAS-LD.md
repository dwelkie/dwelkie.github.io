##### Connecting the Clock and Environmentally Relevent Physiology in Cyanobacteria <br> 
Understanding how photosynthetic bacteria respond to and anticipate natural light–dark cycles is necessary for predictive modeling, bioengineering, and elucidating metabolic strategies for diurnal growth. Here, we identify the genetic components that are important specifically under light–dark cycling conditions and determine how a properly functioning circadian clock prepares metabolism for darkness, a starvation period for photoautotrophs. This study establishes that the core circadian clock protein KaiA is necessary to enable rhythmic derepression of a nighttime circadian program.
